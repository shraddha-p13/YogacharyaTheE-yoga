                        I was like the spiritual version of a trust-fund kid growing up. My parents met at an ashram,
                        where I lived until I was 2 years old.
                        I grew up around Eastern philosophy and spirituality—but when you’re 14 and your parents tell
                        you to do something, you run the other way.
                        When I was 19, I found my way back to my spiritual roots—this time because I chose the
                        lifestyle—and like the trust fund kid who realizes all the luxuries and advantages she had from
                        the start,
                        I saw how blessed I was to have been exposed to such wisdom starting at an early age. By the
                        time I was 24 years old, I had done 15 teacher trainings. I was hooked.
