                    <h3><b>Plant-based diets</b></h3>
                    <h5>Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular
                        versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.</h5>
                    <h5>However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet, which is a
                        plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.</h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container text-left">
                    <p>
                        <b>How it works:</b> There are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all
                        meat, poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.
                    </p>
                    <p>The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting all animal products, as well as
                        animal-derived products like dairy, gelatin, honey, whey, casein, and albumin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no clear-cut rules for the flexitarian diet, as itâ€™s a lifestyle change rather than a
                        diet. It encourages eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains but allows for
                        protein and animal products in moderation, making it a popular alternative.

                        <b>Weight loss:</b> Research shows that plant-based diets are effective for weight loss
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A review of 12 studies including 1,151 participants found that people on a plant-based diet lost
                        an average of 4.4 pounds (2 kg) more than those who included animal products
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Plus, those following a vegan diet lost an average of 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) more than people not
                        eating a plant-based diet
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plant-based diets likely aid weight loss because they tend to be rich in fiber, which can help
                        you stay fuller for longer, and low in high-calorie fat
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Other benefits:</b> Plant-based diets have been linked to many other benefits, such as a
                        reduced risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes. They can
                        also be more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Downsides:</b> Though plant-based diets are healthy, they can restrict important nutrients that are typically found in animal products, such as iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A flexitarian approach or proper supplementation can help account for these nutrients.
