                    <h3><b>Low-carb diets</b></h3>
                    <h5>Low-carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins
                        diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very-low-carb diets like
                        the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or
                        less for other types
                    </h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container text-left">
                    <p>
                        <b>How it works:</b> Low-carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.
                    </p>
                    <p>They’re typically higher in protein than low-fat diets, which is important, as protein can help
                        curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserve muscle mass
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In very-low-carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for
                        energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Weight loss:</b> Many studies indicate that low-carb diets can aid weight loss and may be
                        more effective than conventional low-fat diets
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, a review of 53 studies including 68,128 participants found that low-carb diets
                        resulted in significantly more weight loss than low-fat diets
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        What’s more, low-carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful belly fat
                    </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Other benefits:</b> Research suggests that low-carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart
                        disease, including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve blood sugar
                        and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Downsides:</b> In some cases, a low-carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.
                        Very-low-carb diets can also be difficult to follow and cause digestive upset in some people
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In very rare situations, following a very-low-carb diet may cause a condition known as
                        ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic condition that can be fatal if left untreated
