                    <h3><b>Low-fat diets</b></h3>
                    <h5>Like low-carb diets, low-fat diets have been popular for decades.

                        In general, a low-fat diet involves restricting your fat intake to 30% of your daily calories.

                        Some very- and ultra-low-fat diets aim to limit fat consumption to under 10% of calories
                    </h5>

                <hr>
                <div class="w3-container text-left">
                    <p>
                        <b>How it works:</b> Low-fat diets restrict fat intake because fat provides about twice the
                        number of calories per gram, compared with the other two macronutrients — protein and carbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultra-low-fat diets contain fewer than 10% of calories from fat, with approximately 80% of
                        calories coming from carbs and 10% from protein.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultra-low-fat diets are mainly plant-based and limit meat and animal products.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Weight loss:</b> As low-fat diets restrict calorie intake, they can aid weight loss
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An analysis of 33 studies including over 73,500 participants found that following a low-fat diet
                        led to small but relevant changes in weight and waist circumference
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        However, while low-fat diets appear to be as effective as low-carb diets for weight loss in
                        controlled situations, low-carb diets seem to be more effective day to day
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultra-low-fat diets have been shown to be successful, especially among people with obesity. For
                        example, an 8-week study in 56 participants found that eating a diet comprising 7–14% fat led to
                        an average weight loss of 14.8 pounds (6.7 kg)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Other benefits:</b>Low-fat diets have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and
                        stroke. They may also reduce inflammation and improve markers of diabetes
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        <b>Downsides:</b> Restricting fat too much can lead to health problems in the long term, as fat
                        plays a key role in hormone production, nutrient absorption, and cell health. Moreover,
                        very-low-fat diets have been linked to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome
                    </p>
