                        <b>Q:</b> I’ve been hearing about using light energy for healing. What do you know about the
                        potential for light waves as a way to improve health?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>A:</b> Light has many amazing properties that we often take for granted. For starters,
                        without
                        sunlight there would be no life on Earth. Plants make glucose from sunlight via an incredible
                        process called photosynthesis. When we eat plant foods we benefit from this conversion of light
                        to nutrients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, when sunlight penetrates the top layer of our skin, some of our subcutaneous fat
                        cells (cholesterol) are converted to the very useful pro-hormone vitamin D3. I use a green light
                        in my exam room because it is known to reduce cortisol (a stress hormone). Sometimes the
                        doctor’s office can be a stressful situation, but I do my best to keep things pleasant and
                        even-keeled in mine! And, by now, we’ve all heard about the excessive stimulation and eyestrain
                        caused by blue light emitted by electronic devices, and how wearing amber-tinted glasses can
                        counter that unwanted effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Light is both complex and potent. It is an electromagnetic frequency. There are many
                        frequencies, from super-speedy and damaging gamma rays, through the visible range (ultra-violet
                        to the more slowly undulating infrared) all the way to very slow, high-amplitude radio waves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For therapeutic purposes, the near infrared range (around 700–750 nanometers per second) is the
                        most interesting because it can penetrate the skin and modify biological structures without
                        causing damage. Thousands of studies have shown the positive effects that red and near infrared
                        light has on cell function, which can improve a wide range of conditions such as wound healing,
                        faster recovery from tissue injury (sports), increased hair growth, improved skin appearance
                        through upregulated collagen, improved detoxification capacity, pain relief, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most visible wave lengths (UV, blue, green, yellow) do not penetrate into the body, whereas the
                        red frequencies reach cells, tissues, the blood, nerves, and even the brain. There is a boom of
                        interest in potential for infrared light because more people are waking up to the realization
                        that the single most important guardian of our health is our own immune system. Light therapies
                        work by enhancing the already existing capacity of all life forms to heal themselves, given the
                        basics of good diet, pure water, restful sleep, and exercise. We can significantly slow our
                        inevitable aging process by sticking with the basics, then adding gentle but profound therapies
                        such as infrared light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not just talking about an infrared sauna—although these are absolutely wonderful healing
                        devices to promote detoxification, well-being, improved sleep, and clearer skin. What I have
                        been researching lately is the use of select light frequencies, captured by refracting the light
                        through a precise crystal structure, which can modify our innate healing capacities in very
                        specific ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our bodies contain a musculoskeletal structure, plumbing (heart and blood vessels), electrical
                        (our nervous system is comprised of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves), digestion and
                        elimination organs, skin, and blood. All of these structures are made up of trillions of cells,
                        each of which is made from the same building blocks that make the stars and the planets—carbon,
                        oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, minerals. As you can imagine, these tiny elements can
                        combine in a huge number of different ways, creating different compounds with different
                        functions in the body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One class of compounds that specific light waves can affect is called peptides, naturally
                        occurring biological molecules that are made up of two or more amino acids (proteins). There are
                        some very interesting peptides currently being studied for their “anti-aging” properties.
                        Anti-aging peptide therapy has been around for a while, but up until recently these therapies
                        have been reserved for the rich and famous because of their expense. Plus, peptide and related
                        stem cell therapies have been administered almost exclusively by injection, which is not so
                        comfortable and potentially dangerous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the upside, of course it’s wonderful to look as young as you feel, but the benefits go way
                        beyond cosmetic. We can extend not only our looks but our healthy longevity by using specific
                        peptides to upregulate anti-inflammatory processes, to help the body stay clear of circulating
                        tumor cells, to balance blood sugar, to improve sleep quality, and much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, instead of injecting stem cells, it is possible to increase our bodies’ own peptide
                        production by using the power of specific light frequencies. A fascinating researcher and
                        inventor, David Schmidt, who likes to say he began making crystals with his home science kit at
                        age 14 and never stopped, has created a line of patches that are applied to the skin and contain
                        specific crystals that refract specific wavelengths of light (in the form of near-infrared heat)
                        into the body, causing stimulation of targeted peptides. One particular product I’ve been
                        studying lately uses light to upregulate the copper-linked GHK molecule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cu-GHK is a tripeptide sequence of three amino acids: glycine, lysine, and histidine. Being
                        linked to copper allows for better absorption. From an evolutionary standpoint, the Cu-GHK
                        peptide is a key inducer of multipotent stem cells that emanate from the subcutaneous fat and
                        pigment-producing cells in the skin (melanocytes).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are not embryonic stem cells, which are considered pluripotent and can differentiate into
                        any kind of mammalian tissue. I’m talking about mesenchymal stem cells, which require Cu-GHK for
                        proliferation. Cu-GHK can be induced by a simple patch placed on the skin for 12 hours daily.
                        And this is not a “transdermal” patch like some medical products. No medicine is going through
                        the skin. Only light waves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David Schmidt’s company has a range of products, and he continues to spend much of his time in
                        his laboratory on his life’s work: extending healthy longevity.
