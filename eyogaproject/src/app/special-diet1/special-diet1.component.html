                    <h3><b>Intermittent fasting</b></h3>
                    <h5>Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

                        Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8
                        hours per day, and the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories
                        twice per week.</h5>

                        <b>How it works:</b> Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a
                        simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate
                        by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Weight loss:</b> In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight
                        loss over 3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other methods
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same review showed that this way of eating may reduce waist circumference by 4–7%, which is
                        a marker for harmful belly fat.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle
                        mass, which can improve metabolism.

                        <b>Other benefits:</b> Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased
                        insulin
                        sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Downsides:</b> In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.

                        That said, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels, such as some people with
                        diabetes, low weight, or an eating disorder, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should
                        talk to a health professional before starting intermittent fasting.
