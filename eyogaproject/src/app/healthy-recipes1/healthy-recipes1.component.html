                        I was like the spiritual version of a trust-fund kid growing up. My parents met at an ashram,
                        where I lived until I was 2 years old.
                        I grew up around Eastern philosophy and spirituality—but when you’re 14 and your parents tell
                        you to do something, you run the other way.
                        When I was 19, I found my way back to my spiritual roots—this time because I chose the
                        lifestyle—and like the trust fund kid who realizes all the luxuries and advantages she had from
                        the start,
                        I saw how blessed I was to have been exposed to such wisdom starting at an early age. By the
                        time I was 24 years old, I had done 15 teacher trainings. I was hooked.

                        <h4><b><u>Directions</u></b><br></h4>
                        <br>
                        <b>Step 1</b>
                        <p>

                            Place cauliflower florets and garlic in a steamer basket over boiling water,
                            cover and steam until very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. <br>
                            (Alternatively, place florets and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl with 1/4 cup water,
                            cover and microwave on High for 3 to 5 minutes.)
                        </p>
                        <b>Step 2</b>
                        <p>

                            Place the cooked cauliflower and garlic in a food processor. <br>Add buttermilk, 2 teaspoons
                            oil, butter, salt and pepper; pulse several times, then process until smooth and creamy.
                            <br>
                            Transfer to a serving bowl. Drizzle with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and garnish with
                            chives, if desired. Serve hot.
